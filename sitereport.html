                <p> It could be challenging, but learning HTML and CSS is worthwhile. I couldn't keep up with the amount of information I had to absorb when I first started learning. There were so many tags and syntax requirements to remember that it was difficult to know where to start. But, things started to make sense as I worked on my first project, a straightforward personal website. </p>

                <p> Creating engaging content, designing a layout that is visually appealing, addressing technical issues, ensuring that the website is mobile-compatible, optimizing it for search engines, and managing the website are the key challenges in creating a portfolio website. These challenges can be overcome by careful preparation, paying great attention to the little things, and perseverance. </p>

            <p> Anime character picture was used as a main background image where as Black, Red and White is used as a main theme color. The Sky Blue color is also used in some cases to make the webpage attractive.
             As I am a anime lover so, I used it to dedicate my love toward my favourite anime "DEMON SLAYER". Where as the black and red color that I used for the theme is to show the darkness, lonliness, anger, energy inside me. As, for the white and sky blue color is for showing some lights, happiness left inside me.
